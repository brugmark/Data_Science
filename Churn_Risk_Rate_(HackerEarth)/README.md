# Churn Risk Rate Prediction (HackerEarth)
This notebook is created as part of a [HackerEarth competition](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-customer-churn/). The goal is to predict the churn score for a website based on multiple features related to a userâ€™s demographic, browsing behavior, and historical purchase data, among other details.

For this purpose, the data is explored and prepared and several algorithms (Random Forest, Kernel SVM, Neural Network) are optimized using GridSearchCV. This has resulted in a final score of 74.9 (100 * f1-score).
