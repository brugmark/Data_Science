# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle)
This notebook is created as part of a [Getting Started Prediction competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal is to predict housing prices based on several house characteristics. In addition, another more important general goal, is to apply machine learning knowledge in practice and learn from other notebooks and data enthusiasts/scientists.

For this purpose, the data is explored and prepared and several algorithms:
- Linear
- Ridge
- Lasso
- Elastic Net
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Tree
- Light Gradient Boosting Machine
- Extreme Gradient Boosting
- Neural Network)

Are optimized using GridSearchCV and RFECV. This has resulted in a top 15% score.
