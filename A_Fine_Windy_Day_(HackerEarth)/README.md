# A Fine Windy Day - Power Prediction (HackerEarth)
This notebook is created as part of a [HackerEarth competition](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/predict-the-power-kwh-produced-from-the-windmills-8-f055f832/). The goal is to predict wind turbine power generation in kW/h based on various provided features like temperature, wind direction, turbine status, weather, blade length, etc.

For this purpose, the data is explored and prepared and several algorithms (Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) are optimized using GridSearchCV and RFECV. This has resulted in a final score of 96.3% (100 * R-squared).
